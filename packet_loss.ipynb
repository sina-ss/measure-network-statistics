    "# Measure Packet Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "Packet loss, unlike download and upload speeds, is a measure where lower values are better. Even a small percentage of packet loss can significantly degrade the quality of a VoIP call or online gaming experience, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use decay function for it.\n",
    "The exponential decay function is of the form:  \n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P(p) = L \\cdot e^{-k \\cdot p}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( P(p) \\) is the percentage for a given ping \\( p \\).\n",
    "- \\( L \\) is a scaling factor, typically set to the maximum value (e.g., 100 for percentages).\n",
    "- \\( k \\) is a rate constant that determines how rapidly the percentage decreases with increasing ping."
